We can detect ~.7 standard deviations, which means we won't be able to detect very much, if anything from our "treatment".  

We need to be transparent either way that we are underpowered in our analysis.  IE. if the results go in the direction we want, still note that we have a small amount of people in treatment so we can't decisively conclude anything.  If the results don't go in the direction we want say the same thing.

16 vs 256
